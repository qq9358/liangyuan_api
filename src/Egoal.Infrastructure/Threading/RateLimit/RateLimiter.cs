    /// A rate limiter. Conceptually, a rate limiter distributes permits at a
    /// configurable rate. Each <code>acquire</code> blocks if necessary until a permit is
    /// available, and then takes it. Once acquired, permits need not be released.
    ///
    /// Rate limiters are often used to restrict the rate at which some
    /// physical or logical resource is accessed. This is in contrast to <code>Semaphore</code>
    /// which restricts the number of concurrent accesses instead of the rate
    /// (note though that concurrency and rate are closely related,
    /// e.g. <see href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law">Little's Law</see>).
    ///
    /// A <code>RateLimiter</code> is defined primarily by the rate at which permits
    /// are issued. Absent additional configuration, permits will be distributed at a
    /// fixed rate, defined in terms of permits per second. Permits will be distributed
    /// smoothly, with the delay between individual permits being adjusted to ensure
    /// that the configured rate is maintained.
    ///
    /// It is possible to configure a <code>RateLimiter</code> to have a warmup period 
    /// during which time the permits issued each second steadily increases until it hits the stable rate.
    ///
    /// As an example, imagine that we have a list of tasks to execute, but we don't want to
    /// submit more than 2 per second
    ///
    /// As another example, imagine that we produce a stream of data, and we want to cap it
    /// at 5kb per second. This could be accomplished by requiring a permit per byte, and specifying
    ///  a rate of 5000 permits per second:
    /// <code>  {
    ///     readonly RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.Create(5000.0); // rate = 5000 permits per second
    ///     void SubmitPacket(byte[] packet) {
    ///         rateLimiter.Acquire(packet.Length);
    ///         networkService.Send(packet);
    ///     }
    /// </code>
    ///
    /// It is important to note that the number of permits requested _never_
    /// affect the throttling of the request itself (an invocation to <code>acquire(1)</code>
    /// and an invocation to <code>acquire(1000)</code> will result in exactly the same throttling, if any),
    /// but it affects the throttling of the _next_ request. I.e., if an expensive task
    /// arrives at an idle RateLimiter, it will be granted immediately, but it is the _next_
    /// request that will experience extra throttling, thus paying for the cost of the expensive
    /// task.
    ///
    /// Note: <code>RateLimiter</code> does not provide fairness guarantees.
